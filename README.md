# CTD-DO-Calibration-Example

This worked example was prepared by Kristen Fogaren (fogaren@bc.edu) to include with Oxygen optodes on oceanographic moorings: recommendations for deployment and in-situ calibration by Una Kim Miller, Kristen E. Fogaren, Dariia Atamanchuk, Jannes Koelling, Clare Johnson, Isabela Le Bras, Margaret Lindeman, Hiroki Nagao, David P. Nicholson, Hilary Palevsky, Ellen Park, Meg Yoder, Jaime Palter (doi: ***). 

The following worked example is provided to demonstrate the workflow for calibrating CTD-DO sensors using Winkler samples from data collected on AR69-01. Since SBE does not currently provide processing pipelines for calibration of SBE 43 oxygen sensors, this code is intended to be a starting point for users who are interested in calibrating SBE 43 oxygen sensors using the suggested Seabird oxygen calibration equation. It is specific to our group's file formats, but can be applied to different file formats with alterations of the code.
